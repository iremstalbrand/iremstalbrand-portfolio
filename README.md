# What I Learned

- Learned the basics of HTML and CSS.  
- Gained experience in styling and layout management using CSS.  
- Learned to create page layouts using Flexbox and Grid.  
- Learned how to use Git and GitHub, including version control, commits, push, and pull.  
- Learned that when pushing files to GitHub, background images (PNG) and URLs might not display correctly on GitHub Pages; I fixed it by using relative paths like `./filename.png`.  
- Understood the importance of creating a reference design in Figma to guide development.  
- Learned the fundamentals of responsive design with media queries.  

# Challenges I Faced

- Initially, I didn’t know how to create separate sections, so I put everything on one page using mostly Flexbox.  
- Separating content into distinct sections required adjusting CSS layouts multiple times.  
- Making the site fully responsive across all devices was difficult; media queries helped but didn’t solve everything perfectly.  
- Managing icons, changing their colors and sizes, took a lot of time.  
- Choosing colors, establishing hierarchy between elements, and styling text was challenging.  

# How I Solved Them

- Used Figma reference designs to adjust CSS effectively.  
- Got help from AI, tutorials, and peers to find solutions.  
- Checked for design inspirations.  

# Reflection / Takeaways

- I started with a desktop-first approach; next time, starting with mobile-first could be more efficient.  
- I’m proud to have completed a concrete project as a final result.  
- Some CSS tweaks for full responsiveness might still be needed.  
- The lessons learned and challenges faced will help me make faster and better decisions in future projects.

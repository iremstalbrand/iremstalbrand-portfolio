Reflection:

-At first, I wanted to create different sections, but I didn’t know how, so I put everything on one page using mostly flexboxes.

-Later, I managed to separate the content into distinct sections, which required adjusting CSS layouts again.

-Making the site fully responsive for every device was challenging; media queries helped but didn’t solve everything perfectly.

-I learned that starting with responsive elements from the beginning would make the process easier.

-I started designing for desktop first; next time, I will start with mobile.

-Managing icons was tricky—changing color and size took a lot of time.

-Deciding on colors, hierarchy between elements, and text styling was challenging.

-Creating a reference design in Figma proved very helpful.

-I faced several problems but overcame them with help from people, AI, and tutorials.

-I’m proud to have a concrete project as a final, although some CSS tweaks might still be needed to improve responsiveness.
